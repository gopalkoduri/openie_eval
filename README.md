OpenIE Evaluation Framework
===========================

This repository contains source code for a framework for comparative evaluation of Open Information Extraction (OIE) systems.
Please read the following paper for detailed information about the tasks involved in the framework (TBD). The code is structured 
along three directories:

* **openie_eval** contains the python wrappers necessary for computing/processing text using the existing OIE systems.
* **notebooks** are a set of ipython notebooks, structured and documented in themselves. All tasks in quantitative evaluation
can be found in one notebook, while each task in qualitative evaluation has a notebook each.
* **data** is a folder which has input and output data to/of the OIE systems.

The python wrappers and notebooks are documented in place.
